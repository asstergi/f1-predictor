# FormulaOne2Vec
Code for building the Neural Network and a small subset (both row-wise and column-wise) of the dataset used to calculate the embeddings of the blog post on http://www.f1-predictor.com/

Run `keras_model.py` to build the model and save the resulting embeddings
Execute `plot_embeddings.py` changing the filenames in rows XX and XX in order to plot the respective embeddings using UMAP.
